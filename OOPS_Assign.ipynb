        "### **1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code using **classes and objects** to represent real-world entities. It improves code **reusability, readability, and maintainability**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A class is a **blueprint or template** used to create objects. It defines **properties (variables)** and **methods (functions)** that objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "An object is an **instance of a class**. It represents a real-world entity and can access the properties and methods defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Abstraction** hides implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "* **Encapsulation** bundles data and methods together and restricts direct access to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__add__` that define **built-in behavior** of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Inheritance allows a **child class** to acquire properties and methods of a **parent class**, promoting code reuse and hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Polymorphism allows the **same method or function** to behave differently based on the object or data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using **private variables (`__variable`)**, and accessing them through **methods, getters, setters, or property decorators**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A constructor is a special method `__init__` that is automatically called when an object is created to **initialize object data**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **10. What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Class methods** use `@classmethod` and work with class-level data using `cls`.\n",
        "* **Static methods** use `@staticmethod` and do not access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Method overloading means defining a method that behaves differently based on parameters. Python supports it using **default or variable arguments**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a **child class redefines a method** of its parent class with the same name and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A property decorator allows a **method to be accessed like an attribute**, providing controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Polymorphism improves **flexibility, code reuse, and scalability** by allowing the same interface to work for different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **15. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that **cannot be instantiated** and contains abstract methods that **must be implemented by child classes**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **16. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Advantages of OOP include **code reuse, modularity, scalability, maintainability, and better data security**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Class variable** is shared among all objects of a class.\n",
        "* **Instance variable** is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from **more than one parent class**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__str__` returns a **user-friendly string representation** of an object.\n",
        "* `__repr__` returns a **developer-friendly representation** useful for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",

        "\n",
        "### **21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The `__del__` method is called when an object is **destroyed** and is used for cleanup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `@staticmethod` does not access class or instance data.\n",
        "* `@classmethod` accesses class-level data using `cls`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "In inheritance, polymorphism works through **method overriding**, where the child class provides its own implementation of a parent method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Method chaining is calling **multiple methods on the same object in a single line**, where each method returns the object itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**\n",
