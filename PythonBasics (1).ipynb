What is Python, and why is it popular?**\n","\n","Python is a high-level, simple, and readable programming language. It is popular because it is easy to learn and has powerful libraries for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. What is an interpreter in Python?**\n","\n","An interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line by converting it into machine instructions.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","When you run a Python file, the interpreter executes each line one after another.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n","\n","Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python with fixed meanings. They cannot be used as variable names.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","`if`, `for`, `while`, `class`, `return`\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n","\n","No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because Python has already assigned special meanings to them.\n","\n","**Example (invalid):**\n","`if = 10`  → This gives an error.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. What is mutability in Python?**\n","\n","Mutability refers to whether an object can be changed after it is created.\n","Mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot be changed.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","List is mutable:\n","\n","```\n","a = [1, 2]\n","a.append(3)\n","```\n","\n","String is immutable:\n","\n","```\n","name = \"Bunny\"\n","name[0] = \"C\"   # error\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. Why are lists mutable but tuples are immutable?**\n","\n","Lists are designed to store changeable data, so Python allows editing them.\n","Tuples store fixed data, so Python does not allow modifying their values.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","List:\n","\n","```\n","a = [1, 2]\n","a[0] = 10   # allowed\n","```\n","\n","Tuple:\n","\n","```\n","t = (1, 2)\n","t[0] = 10   # error\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Difference between “==” and “is”?**\n","\n","`==` checks if two values are equal.\n","`is` checks if both refer to the same object in memory.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","```\n","a = [1, 2]\n","b = [1, 2]\n","a == b   # True (values are same)\n","a is b   # False (different objects)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8. What are logical operators in Python?**\n","\n","Logical operators are used to combine or check conditions. They are: `and`, `or`, `not`.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","```\n","x = 5\n","y = 10\n","x < 10 and y > 5   # True\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **9. What is type casting in Python?**\n","\n","Type casting means converting one data type into another.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","```\n","a = \"10\"\n","b = int(a)   # string to integer\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **10. Difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n","\n","Implicit type casting is done automatically by Python when it is safe.\n","Explicit type casting is done manually using functions like `int()` or `float()`.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","Implicit:\n","\n","```\n","a = 5\n","b = 2.0\n","c = a + b    # a automatically becomes float\n","```\n","\n","Explicit:\n","\n","```\n","x = \"20\"\n","y = int(x)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **11. Purpose of conditional statements?**\n","\n","Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions and execute different code blocks when conditions are True.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","```\n","age = 18\n","if age >= 18:\n","    print(\"Adult\")\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **12. How does the elif statement work?**\n","\n","The `elif` statement checks another condition if the previous `if` condition is False.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","```\n","x = 0\n","if x > 0:\n","    print(\"Positive\")\n","elif x == 0:\n","    print(\"Zero\")\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **13. Difference between for and while loops?**\n","\n","A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or when looping over a sequence.\n","A while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","For loop:\n","\n","```\n","for i in range(5):\n","    print(i)\n","```\n","\n","While loop:\n","\n","```\n","count = 1\n","while count <= 5:\n","    print(count)\n","    count += 1\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **14. Scenario where a while loop is more suitable?**\n","\n","A while loop is better when you do not know how many times the loop should run.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","Keep asking for password until correct:\n","\n","```\n","password = \"\"\n","while password != \"1234\":\n","    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n","```\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6Poyl3dJAPk7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
